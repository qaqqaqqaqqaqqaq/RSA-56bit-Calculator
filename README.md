RSA-56bit-Calculator
====================

Encryption and decryption of 256-biti text signal by implementing RSA algorithm




The RSA 256-bit calculator operates the computation of encryption or decryption on FPGA. It cout a0 = a1^(a2) mod a3 by RSA algorithm, where a1, a2, and a3 are less than 256 bits text signal assigned by users and a0 is the result.
